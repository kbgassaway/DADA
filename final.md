## Final: Hack The Box

### Obtain HTB Account

To join HTB go here:  https://www.hackthebox.eu/invite

To get an account with HTB takes more work than simplly entering an email and password. This site is for practicing penetration skills so it's fitting that you need to hack your own way in. More specifically, you have to generate an invitation code.

For my first attempt to create my invite code, I wanted to do something silly and see what happens. My inspiration was from the Little Bobby Tables comic on SQL injection and a character from Stranger Things. “Barb’); DROP TABLE USERS” as I expected, didn’t do anything but return an invalid invite code message.
